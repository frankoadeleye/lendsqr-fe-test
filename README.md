## Project Features

`The form is validated: you have to enter a valid email address and minimum password requirement to continue (which we can edit to our taste)`

`The dashboard API call is handled with Redux (Redux Saga and Axios)`

`The Logout Functionality is working`

`The user is not signed out on page refresh after successful sign in, you have to actually sign out to be signed out`

`The entered email is returned at the nav bar as the name of the admin just for demo purpose, and lots more...`

Thank you
