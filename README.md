  `The dashboard API call is handled with Redux (Redux Saga and Axios)`

  `The Logout Functionality is working`

   `The user is not signed out on page refresh after successful sign in, you have to actually sign out to be signed out`

   `The entered email is returned at the nav bar as the name of the admin just for demo purpose, and lots more...`
